About This Exercise

This exercise was centered around the initial setup of Git using Homebrew on a macOS system, followed by an introduction to data analysis with a focus on the Titanic disaster dataset. Key components of the exercise included configuring Git for version control, which aids in tracking changes and organizing projects efficiently.

The core of the learning experience was encapsulated in a Jupyter notebook, "titanic_disaster.ipynb", where I delved into using Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization. Through this exercise, I gained practical skills in analyzing datasets, starting with the Titanic dataset to explore patterns and insights related to the survival rates of passengers.

Learning to use Pandas allowed me to handle data more effectively, performing operations such as filtering, aggregation, and preprocessing with ease. Meanwhile, Matplotlib provided the tools to visually represent the data, making it possible to convey complex information in an accessible format.

This task served as a foundational step into the world of Python programming for data analysis, emphasizing the importance of version control with Git alongside developing capabilities in utilizing key data science libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.
